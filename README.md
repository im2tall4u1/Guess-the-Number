# Guess-the-Number
My first Python game using if statements and a while loop.
A game where the user will guess a number and if the guess is too high, it will say "Guess lower"
If the guess is too low, it will say "Guess higher"
Will display congratulations along with number of attempts when number has been guessed correctly.
